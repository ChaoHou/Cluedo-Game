Found Something useful:

The issue page on the github could be use to schedule the thing or comment bugs,
It can be synchronized locally into IDEs just like using git,
So I think it's a great tool to communicate, we can use that to replace this text file


Method for Board class:

Delete the method deal Card to Player, because there is no card before the initialize finished.

for movePlayer method: 
if a player is moving into a room, take a unused room inner coordinate to the player
if player is moving out of a room, take the door which meet the player's direction

Require getCharacter(Card.CHARACTER character)//which returns a Chara with given CHARACTER type

For setUpBoard method, the Chara in the player should have a start position on board(whether random or certain)


For Room class:

Field: list of Characters, list of weapons, array of inner coordinates


For Player class:

need to add "Initializing" to STATUS enum 


Method for Frame class:

for enable methods, can make the method behave more automatic? 
For example, if I enableRoll, the other action will be disabled automatically
Same to other enable method,

for initPlayer() method, can you check the characters already own by other players, do not add them to the dropdown
